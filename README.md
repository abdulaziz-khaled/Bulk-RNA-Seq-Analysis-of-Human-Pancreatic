# ðŸ§¬ Bulk RNA-seq Analysis Reveals Gene Expression changes in Human Pancreatic Î²-cells Under Metabolic Stress.
This project performs bulk RNA-Seq data analysis on human pancreatic Î²-cells under metabolic stress using dataset GSE159984. The pipeline includes data retrieval from GEO using SRA Toolkit, quality control with FastQC and MultiQC, read trimming with Trimmomatic, read alignment to the human reference genome (hg38) using STAR/HISAT2, gene quantification with featureCounts, normalization and differential expression analysis with DESeq2, and visualization (PCA, heatmap, and volcano plot). The analysis compares 3 control samples (paired-end) against 3 stressed samples (single-end). All tools used are open-source and run on Ubuntu via WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
